                Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also a sports enthusiast. Playing sports is an essential part of my life. I cannot go a week without engaging in some physical activity. During my time in secondary school, I joined the volleyball team and gained much more than just volleyball skills. My coach taught me a valuable life lesson, that is patience, which is important both on and off the court. As Charles Swindoll once said, "Patience is a bitter plant that produces sweet fruit," and I have learned that patience is key to achieving success in all areas of life.

                I had been Playing piano for two years which was a very rewarding experience.

At the beginning of my piano journey, I am likely focus on building a strong foundation in music theory and piano technique.

But suddenly, I had thought that the most importance in playing piano is to stay patient and persistent, and to focus on enjoying the process of learning and playing music rather than just achieving specific goals.</p>
                
<p class="article__content">In the first year or so of playing violin, I am likely focus on developing proper posture, hand positioning, and bowing technique.

As I progress into my second year of playing, I start to tackle more challenging pieces of music and explore different styles and genres.

Like with piano, staying patient and persistent is key, as is focusing on enjoying the process of learning and playing music rather than achieving specific goals. Also, playing piano can help you to express your creativity and musicality in new and exciting ways.</p>

                One of my purposes for reading academic books is that they can provide in-depth knowledge and understanding of specific subjects.

Reading academic books can be a valuable way to deepen your knowledge and understanding of specific subjects. While it can be challenging, it can also be a rewarding and enriching experience if approached with patience, persistence, and an open mind.

                Photography is a wonderful way to capture and preserve memories, as well as to express my creativity and artistic vision. Through photography, I can capture moments, people, and places in a way that allows me to revisit and appreciate them again and again.

Photography can also be a powerful tool for communication and storytelling. By capturing images that convey a message or tell a story, I can share my experiences and perspectives with my friends.
